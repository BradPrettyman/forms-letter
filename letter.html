        Dear <span class="name"></span>,
      </p>
      <p>I am writing to you out of despair and loneliness. I am writing because I want someone to know the terrible story of my life.</p>
      <p>It all started 11 years ago. I was quite young, barely 20 years old. That unfortunate summer, for some reason, I was restless and unable to stay at home. Instead, I decided to go out into the wilderness, searching for adventure. </p>
      <p>If I knew then what I know now, I would never have hopped on the bus to that godforsaken village, but what’s done is done.</p>
      <p>I decided to test this legend. Not long afterwards, I found the old woman who owned the boarding house alone one day. I strangled her with  my bare hands and, under cover of darkness, I dragged her corpse into the woods. I planned to bring her to the well as a sacrifice.</p>
      <p>Halfway there, I was shocked and frightened to hear heavy footsteps behind me. I was worried that someone had seen me murder the old woman and that my crime had been discovered. But, when I turned around, I saw for myself that there was no one there. The footsteps also ceased. I continued dragging the old lady’s corpse through the trees, all the while keeping one eye over my shoulder.</p>
      <p>Sincerely,</p>
